# Kudos

This project is a sample of a basic contract demonstrating "like" and "tip" functionality using Clarity.

Users can give each other kudos for a small STX fee and optionally give each other tips as well. <br>
The number of kudos a user receives is tracked and can be retrived by a fronted app to display.

### Testing

The test suite can be run with: `clarinet test`
